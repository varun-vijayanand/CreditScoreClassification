# Credit Score Classification Using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify credit scores using machine learning techniques. The provided Jupyter Notebook (Model.ipynb) contains code for training and evaluating various classification models on a dataset of credit scores.

The notebook includes implementations of various machine learning models for credit score classification, including:

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Neighbors Classifier
3. Decision Trees
4. Linear SVC
5. Random Forest

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves are provided for further analysis.
